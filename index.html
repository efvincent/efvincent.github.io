        <p>Lists are one of the fundamental data structures in Haskell and many other programming languages. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a> for example is a portmanteau of "LISt" and "Processing". The implementation of lists in Haskell is also a great way to look at a few different key features of the language that we'll discuss.</p>
<h2 id="no-implicit-prelude">No Implicit Prelude</h2>
<p>Let's do some "first principals" type experimentation. We'll create a module and tell Haskell not to import <code>Prelude</code>, which is the standard library. This will allow us to create our own list types and functions without conflicting with the ones from the standard library.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along, I suggest following these <a href="/2023/02/07/230207-GHCup/" title="Install Haskell with GHCup">installation instructions</a>. Then you can create a file with the <code>*.hs</code> extension.</p>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&#123;-# LANGAUGE NoImplicitPrelude #-&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">module</span> List230207 <span class="keyword">where</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The first line is a compiler directive that excludes Prelude from being automatically imported. The other line defines a module. You can name your module any legal module name; alpha-numeric starting with a capital letter.</p>
<h1 id="a-list-type">A List Type</h1>
<p>We can define a list in Haskell like this (normally we'd use Prelude's list, this is illustrative only):</p>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><figcaption><span>The Lst Type</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&#123;-# LANGUAGE NoImplicitPrelude #-&#125;</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">module</span> List230207 <span class="keyword">where</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> Prelude (<span class="type">Show</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="type">Lst</span> a</span></span><br><span class="line">  = <span class="type">NIL</span></span><br><span class="line">  | <span class="type">Cons</span> a (<span class="type">Lst</span> a)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">deriving</span> (<span class="type">Show</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>After excluding <code>Prelude</code> with the language extension, we add back in something called <code>Show</code>, which will make it easier to display values we're working with in the REPL; don't worry about the details for now.</p>
<h2 id="algebraic-data-types">Algebraic Data Types</h2>
<p>Let's break down the definition of the <code>Lst</code> type by first examining the <code>data</code> keyword, which indicates the beginning of a definition of a new <em>algebraic data type</em>. There are two kinds of algebraic data types - sum types and product types. What we've described above is a <em>sum type</em>. It's called sum because the total number of possible values is the sum of the number of values that each <em>data constructor</em> can produce. Let's look at a simple example:</p>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><figcaption><span>Example Algebraic data type</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="type">Answer</span> </span></span><br><span class="line">  = <span class="type">Yes</span> </span><br><span class="line">  | <span class="type">No</span> </span><br><span class="line">  | <span class="type">LeaningTowards</span> <span class="type">Bool</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">deriving</span> (<span class="type">Show</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In this strange example, we have a data type <code>Answer</code> that has three data constructors. Two of them, <code>Yes</code> and <code>No</code>, take no parameters. The last one, <code>LeaningTowards</code> has a <code>Bool</code> parameter. This means the values, or terms, that inhabit the <code>Answer</code> data type are: <code>Yes</code>, <code>No</code>, <code>LeaningTowards True</code>, and <code>LeaningTowards False</code></p>
<p>The total number of values inhabiting <code>Answer</code> is four, which is the <em>sum</em> of the number of terms that each data constructor can produce. <code>Yes</code> and <code>No</code> can only produce one value each since they have no parameters. Intuitively they behave like values and you'll soon see how in code they're used in places where values are used, but <code>LeaningTowards</code> has a parameter of type <code>Bool</code>, which defines two data constructors (<code>True</code> and <code>False</code>), bringing to total possible values of type <code>Answer</code> to four. Algebra! Sum!</p>
<p>The other type of algebraic data type is the <em>product</em> type. An example is: <figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="type">Quiz</span> = <span class="type">Quiz</span> <span class="type">Answer</span> <span class="type">Answer</span></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The <code>data</code> keyword is the same, indicating we're introducing a new (algebraic) type. The data type is <code>Quiz</code>, and it has one data constructor, also <code>Quiz</code>. Don't be confused by the fact that the type and the one data constructor are both defined as <code>Quiz</code>, they're used in different contexts, so once the idea of types vs type constructors clicks for you, this doesn't present a problem. These are twelve possible values for the type <code>Quiz</code>:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Quiz Yes Yes</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz Yes No</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz Yes (LeaningTowards True)</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz Yes (LeaningTowards False)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>Quiz No Yes</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz No No</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz No (LeaningTowards True)</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz No (LeaningTowards False)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards True) Yes</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards True) No</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards True) (LeaningTowards True)</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards True) (LeaningTowards False)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards False) Yes</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards False) No</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards False) (LeaningTowards True)</code></td>
<td><code>Quiz (LeaningTowards False) (LeaningTowards False)</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The one and only data constructor for <code>Quiz</code> has two parameters of type <code>Answer</code>, and we've seen that <code>Answer</code> has four possible values, therefore the product type <code>Quiz</code> has <code>4 * 4</code> or twelve possible values. Algebra! Product!</p>
<h2 id="kinds-and-polymorphic-aka-generic-types">Kinds and Polymorphic (aka Generic) Types</h2>
<p>The <code>Quiz</code> and <code>Answer</code> are monomorphic types because they contain no type parameters. We say the <strong>kind</strong> of <code>Quiz</code> and <code>Answer</code> is <code>Type</code>. This is best illustrated with an example of a simple <em>polymorphic</em> data type: <figure class="highlight haskell"><figcaption><span>the unbiquitous Maybe type</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="type">Maybe</span> a</span></span><br><span class="line">  = <span class="type">Nothing</span></span><br><span class="line">  | <span class="type">Just</span> a</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The <code>Maybe</code> type is omnipresent in functional programming languages, and some form of it is increasingly found in imperative languages as well. It's typically used to represent a value that may or may not exist. The type itself is parameterized - the <code>a</code> in the example is a <strong>type parameter</strong>. If the <strong>kind</strong> of <code>Quiz</code> is <code>Type</code>, what is the <strong>kind</strong> of <code>Maybe</code>?</p>
<p>it's <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>.</p>
<p>Knowing what we know about Haskell functions, this seems like a function that takes a type and returns a type. That's pretty much what it is. We cannot specify terms to have a type <code>Maybe</code>, because <code>Maybe</code> isn't a <code>Type</code>! it's a <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>, or a <em>higher kinded type</em>. To get a <code>Type</code> from <code>Maybe</code>, you must pass it a <code>Type</code>. For example: <figure class="highlight haskell"><figcaption><span>student quiz results</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="title">s1</span> :: <span class="type">Maybe</span> <span class="type">Quiz</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">s1</span> = <span class="type">Just</span> (<span class="type">Quiz</span> <span class="type">Yes</span> <span class="type">No</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">s2</span> :: <span class="type">Maybe</span> <span class="type">Quiz</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">s2</span> = <span class="type">Nothing</span>       <span class="comment">-- didn&#x27;t take the quiz</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">s3</span> :: <span class="type">Maybe</span> <span class="type">Quiz</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">s3</span> = <span class="type">Just</span> (<span class="type">Quiz</span> <span class="type">No</span> (<span class="type">LeaningTowards</span> <span class="type">Yes</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The kind of <code>Maybe Quiz</code> is <code>Type</code> which means it can be used to specify the type of the terms <code>s1</code>, <code>s2</code>, and <code>s3</code> above.</p>
<p>We see <code>Maybe</code> data constructors <code>Nothing</code> and <code>Just</code> being used here. Either a student took the quiz, represented by <code>Just ...</code> or they didn't, represented by <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-our-list">Back to Our List</h2>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="type">Lst</span> a</span></span><br><span class="line">  = <span class="type">NIL</span></span><br><span class="line">  | <span class="type">Cons</span> a (<span class="type">Lst</span> a)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">deriving</span> (<span class="type">Show</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Now that we understand algebraic data types and higher kinded types, we can see that <code>Lst</code> is kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>, and <code>NIL</code> and <code>Cons Lst</code> are data constructors. So far so good. <code>Lst</code> adds one more concept - a recursively defined, or <em>inductive</em> construct. The first data constructor is <code>NIL</code>, which represents an empty list. The other data constructor, <code>Cons a (Lst a)</code> is recursive; it has two parameters, the first being <code>a</code> which represents the type of values the list can contain, and it the second parameter is a value of type <code>Lst a</code>, another list. Lets look at an example of using our <code>Lst</code> type. <figure class="highlight haskell"><figcaption><span>Lst Example</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">module</span> List230207 <span class="keyword">where</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> Prelude (<span class="type">Show</span>, <span class="type">Int</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">data</span> <span class="type">Lst</span> a</span></span><br><span class="line">  = <span class="type">NIL</span></span><br><span class="line">  | <span class="type">Cons</span> a (<span class="type">Lst</span> a)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">deriving</span> (<span class="type">Show</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">nums</span> :: <span class="type">Lst</span> <span class="type">Int</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">nums</span> = <span class="type">Cons</span> <span class="number">1</span> (<span class="type">Cons</span> <span class="number">2</span> (<span class="type">Cons</span> <span class="number">3</span> <span class="type">NIL</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>In this example <code>nums</code> is a <code>Lst Int</code> , or a list of integers. I've included <code>Int</code> in the list of identifiers being imported from Prelude so we could specify the type parameter for <code>Lst</code> to be specifically <code>Int</code>. Noticed how we declare constants in a similar way that we declare functions, the type specification comes before the assignment (see this post on <a href="/2023/02/06/230206-Haskell-Basics-01/" title="Haskell Basics - Functions 01">functions for more info</a>). This is effectively how Haskell's standard library implements the list type, only since lists are so common and heavily used, there's some syntactic sugar in Haskell syntax that makes working with lists much more bearable and intuitive. We'll see these later, but our definition is definitely a valid way to represent lists.</p>
<p>So now that we've got a list defined ... we need to do something with it. Next time we'll work with our list type in creating some functions you typically use with lists - things like getting the length, appending one list to another, and mapping values in a list using a function to create a new list.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>A quick and easy way to get Haskell set up and keep it up to date is to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">GHCup</a>. Follow the link for directions. GHCup will install a few different components. Haskell has a history of what is, by modern standards, poor tooling. It's not a new language, Haskell was developed in the early 90s, and for the first couple of decades of its existence was mostly an academic programming language, and it shows.</p>
<p>Things are far better now, but not quite as slick as Golang or Rust's ecosystems which have the benefit of being recently developed with contemporary thinking about tooling and package management. Here's some initial guidance.</p>
<h2 id="ghc---glasgow-haskell-compiler"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> - Glasgow Haskell Compiler</h2>
<p>The open source compiler for Haskell. Technically this is just <em>one</em> of the Haskell compilers available, as the intent of Haskell was to be a specification and not an implementation, thereby not locking anyone into a single compiler.</p>
<p>The reality is that most people are using GHC, and that most experimentation and expansion of the Haskell specification is happening in GHC. It's considered the most advanced Haskell compiler and to make your life simpler, just go with GHC and forget that there are other choices, until you find a compelling reason to do so.</p>
<h2 id="cabal">Cabal</h2>
<p>The standard package system for Haskell software, and for the longest time was <strong>the</strong> way to build Haskell programs, find and download packages, and build and publish packages. Many people still use Cabal, and it's not too bad. I personally don't I use the next tool in the list.</p>
<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>
<p>aka The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/">Haskell Tool Stack</a>, it's a program for working with Haskell projects, and is a bit more modern in its approach. This is the approach I use, and while <em>still</em> not perfect, it's at least somewhat reasonable, and once you establish a practice it's trivial to use Stack for package and product management. Stack actually leverage Cabal internally to do the actual work of package management, so the're reasonably compatible and interchangeable.</p>
<h2 id="hls"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">HLS</a></h2>
<p>The Haskell Language Server, an implementation of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for Haskell. The Language Server Protocol, or LSP, defines a protocol use between an editor or IDE and a language server that provides language features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references, etc.. For a long time (and this is where the poor tooling rep was spot on), you would have a hard time working with Haskell outside of Emacs. With the HLS, we get a decent language aware IDE from VSCode, and many other editors that are now LSP aware.</p>
<h1 id="using-the-repl">Using the REPL</h1>
<p>Once you've got the Haskell tooling installed and before you get involved with setting up a full project with either Stack or Cabal, to get your feet wet you can use the REPL combined with a single Haskell file like this: <figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ <span class="comment"># create your source file</span></span><br><span class="line">$ <span class="built_in">touch</span> scratch.hs  <span class="comment"># or whatever you want to call it</span></span><br><span class="line">$ stack repl scratch.hs</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>This starts the REPL. You'll see a prompt <code>Prelude&gt;</code>, indicating you've got the REPL with Prelude (the standard library), and your file is loaded (even if it's empty). From here, you can use a few of these handy REPL commands:</p>

<h2 id="editing-your-file">Editing Your File</h2>
<p>The REPL is handy of course for trying things out. But since it's only one line at a time (there's a kind of multi-line ability but it's not great), it's handy to have a file in your REPL session. You can either keep the file open in your favorite editor and iterate over it making changes, and periodically reload into the REPL with the <code>:r</code> command, or you can use the <code>:e</code> command to fire up your default editor (VIM in my case) make edits, and when you save/quit, the REPL will automatically reload your source file.</p>
<p>That's the basics... Happy Hacking!</p>

        <p>The syntax for function definition in Haskell is different from most other programming languages, especially mainstream programming languages. Let's take a look at a simple function.</p>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- | Perform math operation on two integers</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy</span> :: <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy</span> m n = (m * <span class="number">10</span>) + n</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>If you're new to Haskell this will look very strange. The first thing to notice is that the first line (after the comment) is the type declaration for the function. A variable <code>mathy</code> is going to be bound to the definition of this function. In Haskell once a variable is bound it cannot be changed. In Haskell values are immutable and once a variable is bound to a variable, including functions, they cannot be altered.</p>
<p>The double colon <code>::</code> is how we define <em>type signatures</em>, so the first line says that <code>mathy</code> has the type <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, which we can think of as the type signature of a function. in this case there are 3 parts separated by right arrows <code>-&gt;</code>. Using conventional terminology, you might say that each part is a parameter of the function except the last, which is the return value of the function. Therefore we can say that <code>mathy</code> takes two <code>Int</code> parameters and returns an <code>Int</code> value.</p>
<p>The next line is the definition. The variable bound to the function is separated by its parameters by whitespace. <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the parameters of the function. The "body" of the function is the expression after the equal sign, <code>(m * 10) + n</code>.</p>
<h2 id="calling-functions">Calling Functions</h2>
<p>Once the function is defined it can be called with parameters to return a value. <figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; mathy <span class="number">21</span> <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">215</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; mathy <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">8</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">88</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<h2 id="arrow---the-type-of-functions">Arrow - The Type of Functions</h2>
<p>Aside from the different syntax we've just seen, the first real big significant difference between Haskell and most other languages is that the arguments are simply listed after the function name; no parentheses or commas.</p>
<h3 id="partial-application">Partial Application</h3>
<p>More significantly, we can call a function without passing <em>all the arguments</em> to the function. Let's take a look at the function, it's type, and the types of values that come from calling the function in different ways. Note the command <code>:type</code> at the REPL returns the type (it can be abbreviated <code>:t</code>).</p>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; <span class="comment">-- the type of the function bound to mathy</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; :t mathy</span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy</span> :: <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; <span class="comment">-- callng with one parameter</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; :t mathy <span class="number">8</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy</span> <span class="number">8</span> :: <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; <span class="comment">-- calling the all parameters</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; :t mathy <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy</span> <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">4</span> :: <span class="type">Int</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You should be seeing the pattern here. Arrow <code>-&gt;</code> is actually a polymorphic type constructor, in some other languages called a generic type. Specifically it's a generic type in two type variables, the input (on the left of the arrow) and the output (on the right of the arrow). In C#, the type of anonymous functions is <code>Func&lt;T,TReturn&gt;</code>, a polymorphic type in two type variables, the first <code>T</code> is the type of input, and the second <code>TReturn</code> is the type of output. Java has a similar generic type for anonymous functions.</p>
<h3 id="infix">Infix</h3>
<p>Haskell has the notion of <em>infix</em> operators, and that's what <code>-&gt;</code> is, an <em><strong>infix</strong></em> <em>polymorphic type constructor</em>. Functions and type constructors are typically post fix; the arguments go after the function name. Infix works like the plus sign, which represents the addition function. The plus sits between the two numbers being added. Haskell lets us define functions, and type constructors, as infix.</p>
<p>We could define our <code>mathy</code> function that's infix: <figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- | An infix version of mathy</span></span><br><span class="line">(++++) :: <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span></span><br><span class="line">(++++) m n = (m * <span class="number">10</span>) + n</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Then it could be called infix style, like you would addition: <figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; <span class="number">8</span> ++++ <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">85</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>You can also call non symbolic functions in an infix style by surrounding it with back tick characters. <figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- infix calling of mathy</span></span><br><span class="line">&gt; <span class="number">8</span> `mathy` <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">85</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>We can see that <code>-&gt;</code> is a type constructor by assigning an alias that's not symbolic. We'll use the same name as the C# type for anonymous functions. <figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- | create a type that&#x27;s an alias for arrow</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="class"><span class="keyword">type</span> <span class="type">Func</span> = (-&gt;)</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">-- | using Func to define a function. It has the same type</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">--   as mathy, so we can assign it directly</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy2</span> :: <span class="type">Func</span> <span class="type">Int</span> (<span class="type">Func</span> <span class="type">Int</span> <span class="type">Int</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathy2</span> = mathy</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>It's now even more clear that <code>mathy2</code>, like <code>mathy</code> is actually a function that takes an integer and produces a function that takes an integer and produces an integer. We can do this:</p>
<figure class="highlight haskell"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&gt; mathyOfEight = mathy <span class="number">8</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="title">mathyOfEight</span> :: <span class="type">Int</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Int</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; mathyOfEight <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">85</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">&gt; mathy <span class="number">8</span> <span class="number">5</span> == mathyOfEight <span class="number">5</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="type">True</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>We've seen that in Haskell a function is defined using a type signature, and a function body. We've seen the Haskell arrow <code>-&gt;</code> type, which is the type of functions, and we've seen how we can partially apply functions to create new functions with fewer arguments. A future post will get into a bit more of the syntax of functions in Haskell.</p>

        <p>I'm restarting this blog after several years of inattention. I've rebooted a few times over the years, but failed in the past to keep it up. Now I feel the need to capture my experiences, interests, and path of further education, for my own sake. I look to this as a purpose where before I can't say I had one. So with this in mind, off I go.</p>
<h2 id="parting-with-the-past">Parting with the Past</h2>
<p>I have a few posts from the past, most of which are more than 12 years old. In previous reboots I incorporated those post in new versions of this blog. Some of them are still interesting, possibly even relevant. But I've changed significantly in the last dozen years. Connecting my thoughts of 12+ years ago with my current thinking seems feels forced. I'm no longer intrigued by the possibility or writing multi-threaded algorithms for the browser in Silverlight!</p>
<p>So with that I'm putting all those articles into an archive. This with be the new oldest post. The new, Fresh Start.</p>
<h1 id="areas-of-interest">Areas of Interest</h1>
<p>There are many. Too many. It's a wonderful problem to have. I sit in my den on a Sunday morning, put a playlist from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS7CucNrX3f6JCuIj_ugZpA">Total Baroque</a> channel on the entertainment system, and have to choose what to spend the next few hours studying, practicing, writing. Today I'm getting this blog back on its feet; consider that area of interest #1.</p>
<p>I'm using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io">Hexo</a> to generate the blog because I wanted a simple static site generator that allows the authoring of posts using straight markdown. My posts won't be locked into a too-proprietary system. I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https:/obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> heavily for notes, and I can set up the source for my blog to also be an Obsidian "vault", allowing me to work on blog posts with the same tools that I use all the time for other purposes. In the past I've used blog systems that were also tied to my current interest... but as interests change, so did my desire to keep up with whatever esoteric blogging approach I was using. Hexo is a node based system, simple to set up and use and, importantly, simple to come back to and be able to continue using without having to remember a series of bespoke incantations. Let's see how long this lasts.</p>
<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h2>
<p>What a broad topic. I've got to take this back to about 2006. Around this time (I'm not going to look up specific dates) I was working as an independent contractor / consultant sub-contracting under Microsoft Consulting, building a system for the Pinellas county tax collector in Clearwater Florida. It was Microsoft stack, C# specifically, a distributed system, "thick" client (what we called native apps at the time) using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model">DCOM</a>, a now obsolete distributed networking stack.</p>
<h3 id="c-gets-linq">C# gets Linq</h3>
<p>Around this time Microsoft added <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">Linq</a> to C# and the .NET ecosystem. Linq is marketing speak for a combination of runtime, language, and library extensions that "<em>adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages</em>". This amounted to adding anonymous functions to C#, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_method#">extension methods</a>, and an abstraction called <code>IEnumerable</code> that make it reasonably intuitive to write and compose functions we'd now recognize as building on maps and folds.</p>
<p>This was a bit shocking and revolutionary at a time when "functional" concepts had not yet started to become ubiquitous in the most popular OO ecosystems, Java and .NET. I remember specifically working with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maresca/">Jerry Maresca</a>, one of the senior engineers from Microsoft (with whom I greatly enjoyed working), hungrily consuming these new capabilities and libraries, and experimenting with the new approaches to both low level algorithm implementations, but also what this meant for the structure and organization of entire programs. Object Oriented programming had been the norm for "line of business" programming since the late 80s / early 90s.</p>
<p>Linq and the associated technologies and libraries squeezed functional concepts (which interestingly enough is not a term that has a single, well accepted defintion), into what remains to this day a <em>very</em> object oriented ecosystem. As we began to see the elegance and utility of thinking of problems in terms of functions, functional composition, and data structures uncoupled from the functions by which they are manipulated (ie <em>methods</em>). This is directly at odds with object oriented thinking, and we did some <em>strange</em> experiments combining these paradigms using these early tools.</p>
<p>But the real benefit for me was to open my eyes to the possibility of significantly different ways to think about computing at all levels. In short, I thought I had fairly complete knowledge of the landscape of production software engineering and computer programming, and to realize how wrong I was about that was captivating and exciting!</p>
<h2 id="a-pivotal-discussion-over-lunch">A Pivotal Discussion over Lunch</h2>
<p>A couple of years later, working again with Microsoft Consulting with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stcohen/">Stephen Cohen</a> (Chief Architect at Microsoft), this time for the Department of State in DC, I was at lunch with Stephen and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggmiller12345/">Randy Miller</a>. The topic of Lisp came up, at the time i was aware of lisp, but had failed to have any interest in a language that was outside of the ecosystem in which I was immersed. Randy made a compelling argument supporting his admiration and appreciation for lisps which piqued my curiosity.</p>
<p>Over the next weeks during frequent visits to the local Borders where several of us on that gig would hang out in evenings (we were "on the road" in DC from all over the country for this gig), I began seeking out and reading about Lisps and other languages. I wandered the field and eventually came across OCaml, and after playing with it a bit and gaining interest, fell upon a research project being worked on by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Syme">Don Syme</a> of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Research">Microsoft Research</a>, a discovery that would radically alter the course of my journey.</p>
<h2 id="f">F#</h2>
<p>Don Syme was developing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>, a descendant of OCaml for the .NET framework at around the time I was having that lunch with Stephen and Randy. F# was still a couple of years away from production ready release, but you could get your hands on the compiler from the Microsoft Research site, and with some fiddling you could actually use it in an ecosystem (.NET) which was rich enough to make the endeavor worth while.</p>
<p>This was a major tipping point for me. I was now obsessed with this new way of thinking about writing software. I'd eventually come to understand that functional programming wasn't new at all, and importantly, function programming opens the door to a universe of cross disciplinary thought. I spent several years of using F# on my own time, and also building an appreciation for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">Clojure</a> (a JVM lisp), but never having the opportunity to use either professionally. That would change when I was cold contacted by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimeegerzofsky/">Aimee Gerzofsky</a> a recruiter at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet.com">Jet.com</a>.</p>
<p>Jet.com was an e-commerce startup, pre-launch in 2015. The interesting part - they were an F# shop! This was 90% of the reason I would eventually join Jet and move to the NY area. I was working <strong>full time in a functional programming language</strong>. This was then and remains now far and away the best job I've ever had. I was being paid to spend thousands of hours over the next few years writing code that I would have been writing on my own time. F# remains a favorite of mine, though my current interests have moved on to find and probe the more exotic regions of the computer science landscape.</p>
<h1 id="haskell">Haskell</h1>
<p>A few years later I found myself with a deep interest in Haskell. I had taken a few shots at learning Haskell (which happens to many I've since learned), giving up and returning to the familiar, comfortable lands of F#, Clojure, and OCaml, before it finally started to click for me. This corresponded to a push toward management in my career.</p>
<p>This "push" was not driven by my interests, but rather that of the companies for whom I worked. This is common for software engineers as they hit the 10, 15, 20 year marks in their career. Companies will place a hand firmly in the small of your back and shove you into management, where your skills will immediately start to fade as thoughts of budgets, timelines, recruiting, career planning, and most disruptively, the authoring and delivery of endless power point presentations take the time you'd rather spend writing beautiful code. Sigh.</p>
<p>Most of my spare time was spent diligently building my intuition for the pure functional world of Haskell. This is an ongoing endeavor to this day. Haskell is my favorite general purpose programming language, and once again I find myself fixated on technologies that I will very likely never have the opportunity to work on professionally; this serves only to motivate me further.</p>
<h1 id="gödel-escher-bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</h1>
<p>In the last several years, starting in approximately 2018, I crossed paths with several topics that were not obviously connected with my interest in functional programming. I received a copy of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Back</a> (Hofstadter, 1979) (G.E.B.) from my family as a birthday or Christmas gift (I forget which), it had been on my wish list for some time. I knew nothing about it other than it appeared on the must read lists of several people I admired or followed.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I had come across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wadler">Phil Wadler's</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">Propositions as Types</a> talk from Strange Loop 2015, which broke my brain. Wadler was talking about something that was obviously profound and fascinating, and I didn't understand 25% of it. But the fuse was once again lit for me. There was a connection between logic (which I knew nothing about), and computer science, and it was fascinating... more to come.</p>
<p>Also around the same time, my daughter was at Kenyon College studying philosophy and the classics. She had taken a course on Propositional Logic, and in chatting about it I came to realize that the topic had much overlap with the boolean logic that's a deep and integral aspect of computer programming. Add propositional logic to the list of topics in which I suddenly found myself deeply interested.</p>
<h3 id="all-things-connected">All Things Connected</h3>
<p>Between the beginning of my studying G.E.B., discovering the idea of Proposition as Types, opening a line of studying of propositional logic, and all of the studying of functional programming I've done over several years, I came to understand the underpinnings of all these topics are related. Abstract Mathematics. Another shocking discovery for me - mathematics, a topic for which I would regularly declare an unabashed disdain for my entire life until this point, had stealthily worked it's way into my academic life to suddenly spring forth and become the center of my universe. I had to, and still have to suppress the feeling that had I come to this realization 30 years sooner, I would be in a very different place indeed. Such, as they say, is life.</p>
<h3 id="the-academics">The Academics</h3>
<p>Which brings me, finally, to the remainder of the list of my interests. They include, but are not limited to:</p>
